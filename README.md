# Real-Time Automated Attendance System with Multi-Face Recognition and Liveness Detection

## 📌 Project Overview
This project introduces a **Real-Time Automated Attendance System** designed to improve **security** and **efficiency** in attendance management.  
It integrates **deep learning-based facial recognition** with **liveness detection** to:
- Accurately detect and recognize **multiple faces simultaneously**  
- Verify the **authenticity** of individuals (preventing spoofing with photos or videos)  
- Automatically log attendance in a secure database  

By automating the process, the system eliminates manual tracking, reduces errors, and ensures only genuine individuals are marked present.

## 🚀 Features
- **Multi-face recognition** in real-time  
- **Liveness detection** to prevent spoofing attacks  
- **Secure attendance storage** in a database  
- **Automated process** reduces human error  
- Scalable solution suitable for:  
  - Organizations  
  - Educational institutions  
  - Workplaces  

## 🛠️ System Workflow
1. **Face Capture** – Real-time camera feed captures facial images  
2. **Face Recognition** – Deep learning model detects and identifies individuals  
3. **Liveness Detection** – Ensures the detected face is genuine  
4. **Attendance Logging** – Records presence securely in the database  

## 📊 Benefits
- Enhances **security** through anti-spoofing mechanisms  
- Saves **time** compared to manual attendance  
- Improves **accuracy** of records  
- Provides a **scalable and automated solution** for multiple users
